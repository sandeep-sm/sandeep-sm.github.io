I'm a Senior Research Engineer at Samsung, working in the Vision Research Group which contributes to the latest vision based solutions for Samsung flagship devices. Currently I am working on an Image & Video Super-Resolution solution for the device capture pipeline. I aspire to work in the intersection of computer vision and human cognition. I am also interested in developing novel efficient architectures for deploying such solutions on resource contrained devices.

I graduated with a Master's (Honors) and Bachelor's in Tech. from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I specialize in Visual Image Processing and Embedded systems. I also did my minor in Computer Science and Engineering at the same place. 

Apart from working on research projects in college, I have also worked independently and published a paper -- [RecSal : Deep Recursive Supervision for
Visual Saliency Prediction](https://www.bmvc2020-conference.com/assets/papers/0539.pdf) in [BMVC](https://www.bmvc2020-conference.com/) 2020. I wish to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science to further my education.
