I am an ECE PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, guided by [Prof. Alan Bovik](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/alan-bovik).
I am a member of [Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE)](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/index.php), where we work towards the development and optimization of blind/non-blind image and video quality assessment/enhancement techniques. I am also highly interested in generative modeling for image/video and 3D content, focusing on making generative methods more accessible to the creator community. 

During my PhD, I have had the opportunity to work at ByteDance and Google Research (ongoing) as a research intern.

Before pursuing a PhD, I worked as a Lead Research Engineer at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore in the Vision Research Group, which primarily contributes to the latest vision-based solutions for Samsung's flagship devices. While at Samsung, we developed an Image Super-Resolution solution for the device Gallery, which has been deployed on various Samsung devices across the globe since 2020. We also developed a Video Super-Resolution solution for the device capture pipeline.

I graduated with a dual degree from the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My specialization was Visual Image Processing and Embedded Systems. I also completed a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.
