I'm a Senior Research Engineer at Samsung, working in the Vision Research Group which contributes to the latest vision based solutions for Samsung flagship devices. Currently I am working on a Image and Video Super-Resolution solution for the device capture pipeline. I aspire to work in the intersection of Computer vision and Human cognition. I am also interested in developing novel efficient architectures for deploying such solution on resource contrained devices.

I graduated with a Master's (Honors) and Bachelor's in Tech. from the Departement of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I specialize in Visual Image Processing and Embedded systems. I also did my minor in Computer Science and Engineering at the same place. 

Apart from working on research projects in college, I have also worked independently and published a paper titled: "" in BMVC'20. I have had the opportunity to pursue research in deep learning even during my industrial experience and now I wish to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science to further my education.
