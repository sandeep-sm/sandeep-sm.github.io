title: "Re-IQA : Unsupervised Learning for Image Quality Assessment in the Wild"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/4
excerpt: 'Prior image quality assessment methods either focus on developing a model to seggregate different types of synthetic distortions or use pre-trained 
deep networks to generate image features which surprisingly perform very good when compared to human opinion scores. Using the above premise we propose a 
Mixture of Experts approach to prioritize both distortion-aware features and content-aware features to improve image quality assessment in the Wild. To
learn content-aware features we re-use Momentum Contrastive v2 paradigm trained on ImageNet dataset. For learning distortion-aware features we modify 
the MoCo-v2 framework with a novel Image-Augmentation scheme, an Intra-Pair Image Swapping scheme and an overlapping-area based cropping technique which 
facilitates the generatation of "similar-quality" and "different-quality" image pairs. The learnt features from both the content-aware and distortion-aware 
domain are combined and used for quality score prediction using a regressor head. We achieve state-of-the-art results in most of the publicly available IQA 
databases. We also demonstrate how content-aware features play a significant role in the "Images in the Wild" scenario, while distortion-aware features play a similar role in synthetically distorted datasets where the reference image is available. This work is currently under review.'
