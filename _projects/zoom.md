title: "AI Gallery Zoom and Video Super Resolution"
collection: projects
permalink: /projects/zoom
excerpt: 'Most of the platforms we use to share images. like Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram. compress images while sharing to reduce data consumption. This leads to image quality degradation. To mitigate this we designed an AI Gallery zoom feature which uses an AI based upscaler replacing the current hardware scaler. When a user zooms into an image this feature improves overall image quality and sharpness without introducing any visible artifacts. The network has been designed such that it uses minimal power and compute requirements to achieve superior results. You can checkout more about this work [here](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/AI-powered-Gallery-Zoom/td-p/5386402).'
